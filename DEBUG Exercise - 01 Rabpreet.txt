Question 1: You have been tasked with reviewing and updating this program. What steps would you take to identify any issues in the code?
Response:

Review Variable Declarations: Ensure that all declared variables are initialized and correctly named (e.g., firstTest, secondTest, average, PASSING). Verify that all variables are used appropriately throughout the program.

Check for Missing Input Statements: The code is prompting the user to "Enter first score or 0 to quit" but does not capture the input for firstTest at that point. The program needs an input statement to assign the user's value to firstTest. I'll add the following line:

pseudocode
Copy code
input firstTest
Verify While Loop Condition: Check that the condition of the while loop is logical. The loop should continue while firstTest <> 0. I'll also change "not equal to" to <> to improve clarity and consistency in the pseudocode.

Correct Arithmetic Operation: Ensure the calculation of the average is correct. In the line:

pseudocode
Copy code
average = firstTest + secondTest / 2
The division has precedence over addition. I'll add parentheses to ensure proper order of operations:

pseudocode
Copy code
average = (firstTest + secondTest) / 2
Ensure Proper Loop Execution: After outputting the result (either "Pass" or "Fail"), prompt the user again for the next firstTest score or 0 to quit. This requires adding:

pseudocode
Copy code
input firstTest
Review Output Statements: Ensure all outputs are correctly formatted and spelled (e.g., output is misspelled as ouput).

Question 2: What actions could the developer have taken to minimize the number of errors?
Response:

Input Validation: The developer should have included validation for the inputs to ensure that the values for firstTest and secondTest are valid numeric values.

Thorough Testing and Debugging: Running tests to check common edge cases (e.g., entering a value of 0 to ensure the program exits, or inputting values below and above the PASSING threshold) could help prevent logical errors.

Proper Use of Parentheses: The developer should have used parentheses in arithmetic operations to ensure correct precedence, especially in the case of mixing addition and division.

Clear Documentation: Including comments and meaningful variable names would make the code easier to understand and debug in the future.

Consistent Pseudocode Formatting: The developer should have used consistent symbols (e.g., <> instead of "not equal") to enhance readability and uniformity in the pseudocode.

Debugging Exercise - Corrected Pseudocode
pseudocode
Copy code
start
    // Declarations
    num firstTest
    num secondTest
    num average
    num PASSING = 60

    // Prompt the user to enter the first score or 0 to quit
    output "Enter first score or 0 to quit"
    input firstTest

    // Loop while firstTest is not equal to 0
    while firstTest <> 0
        output "Enter second score"
        input secondTest

        // Calculate the average of the two test scores
        average = (firstTest + secondTest) / 2

        // Output the average score
        output "Average is ", average

        // Check if the average is greater than or equal to PASSING
        if average >= PASSING then
            output "Pass"
        else
            output "Fail"
        endif

        // Prompt the user to enter the next first score or 0 to quit
        output "Enter first score or 0 to quit"
        input firstTest
    endwhile

stop
Explanation of Corrections:
Added Input for firstTest: Before entering the loop, I added an input statement to capture the user's first score.
Fixed while Loop Condition: Changed "not equal to" to <> for consistency and clarity.
Corrected the Arithmetic Operation: Added parentheses around the sum of firstTest and secondTest to ensure the addition is performed before the division.
Spelling Corrections: Fixed the typo in the output statement (changed ouput to output).
Ensured Loop Continuity: Added the input prompt for firstTest within the loop to allow multiple rounds of score entries.
