START

DECLARE accountBalance AS FLOAT

DECLARE overdrawnFee, totalFee AS FLOAT

DECLARE numOverdrawn AS INTEGER

CONSTANT FEE_PERCENTAGE = 0.01

CONSTANT BASE_FEE = 5.00

PRINT "Enter the account balance: "

INPUT accountBalance

PRINT "Enter the number of times the account was overdrawn: "

INPUT numOverdrawn

SET overdrawnFee = (accountBalance * FEE_PERCENTAGE) - (numOverdrawn * BASE_FEE)

SET totalFee = overdrawnFee

SET accountBalance = accountBalance - totalFee

PRINT "The total fee is: $", totalFee

PRINT "The new account balance is: $", accountBalance
