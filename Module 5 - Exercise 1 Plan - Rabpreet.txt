Exercise 1 - Planning
1. Number of Questions:

Total Questions: Decide on a fixed number of questions, such as 10. This allows for a manageable game length and helps maintain player interest.
Categories: You might also consider categorizing questions (e.g., History, Science, Pop Culture) to make the game more engaging.

2. Timing Constraints:

Time Limit: Set a specific time limit for answering each question, such as 30 seconds. This adds an element of pressure and excitement.
Countdown Mechanism: Implement a countdown timer that visually shows how much time is left for the player to respond.

3. Expected Correct Answers:

Response Format: Ensure all answers are phrased in the form of a question. For example, for the answer “The capital of France,” the player should respond with “What is Paris?”
Feedback Mechanism: Provide immediate feedback after each answer, indicating whether it was correct or incorrect.

4. Roles:

Contestant: The player who answers the questions.
Moderator: The person who reads the questions, tracks scores, and manages the flow of the game.

5. Scoring System:

Points Allocation:
Award points for correct answers (e.g., +100 points).
Deduct points for incorrect answers or for failing to respond within the time limit (e.g., -50 points).
Score Tracking: Maintain a running total of each player’s score throughout the game.

6. Game Flow:

Turn Structure: Decide if players will take turns answering questions or if it will be a single contestant format.
Multiple Rounds: Consider incorporating multiple rounds with increasing difficulty or different categories.
Ending the Game: Plan how the game will conclude, such as after all questions have been answered or after a set time limit.
Example Plan Outline
Start Game:

Initialize player scores (set all to zero).
Prepare a list of questions and corresponding correct answers.
Game Loop:

For each question:
Display the question to the player.
Start the timer.
Capture the player's response.
Validate the response:
If correct, increase the score.
If incorrect or time runs out, reveal the correct answer.

End Game:

Display the final score and congratulate the player.
Prompt the player to see if they want to play again.
